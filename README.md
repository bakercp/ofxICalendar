ofxICalendar
============

A calendar-based event scheduler.  Useful for sending calendar events to your openFrameworks app.

Place key=value or json style settings in the event descriptions and pass that data to your app when the time comes.

Turn installations on and off.  Make your Raspberry Pi powered alarm clock wake you up at the right time.

Remote control your installation using a Google Calendar.
